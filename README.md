# flashcard_generator

With this awesome Flashcard Generator, you can study up with pre-made flashcards that are stored in a mysql database, or you can make your own custom flascards. The flascards come in two varieties. Front and back style question and answer cards, or cloze cards, which generate a statement with a key word missing that needs to be filled in by you. This is a great way to learn a new skill!
