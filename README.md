# flashcard_generator

With this awesome Flashcard Generator, you can study with pre-made flashcards that are stored in a mysql database, or you can make your own custom flascards. The flascards come in two varieties. One is a front and back style question and answer card set. The second is a cloze card set, which generates a statement, with a key word missing that needs to be filled in by you. This is a great way to learn a new skill!
